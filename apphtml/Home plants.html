<p1><strong> Look at this plant. You could say it has some interesting fruit. Some might say the fruit does not even look that tasty. However, this is a cacao tree, and its seeds are the source of chocolate. So, there are some people who would argue that this is one of the most important plants in the whole plant kingdom.</strong></p1>

<h2> <em> The Importance of Plants</em>  </h2>
<p2> <em>The importance of plants to humans and just about all other life on Earth is staggering. Life as we know it would not be possible without plants.</em></p2>

<h3> Why are plants so important? </h3>
<!--tag called <p> represents the paragraph-->
<p3>Plants supply food to nearly all terrestrial organisms, including humans. We eat either plants or other organisms that eat plants.</p3>
<br> Plants maintain the atmosphere. <br> They produce oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide during photosynthesis.<br>  Oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms.<br>  It also maintains the ozone layer that helps protect Earth’s life from damaging UV radiation.<br>  Removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reduces the greenhouse effect and global warming.<br>
Plants recycle matter in biogeochemical cycles.<br>  For example, through transpiration, plants move enormous amounts of water from the soil to the atmosphere.<br>  Plants such as peas host bacteria that fix nitrogen. <br> This makes nitrogen available to all plants, which pass it on to consumers.<br>

Plants provide many products for human use, such as firewood, timber, fibers, medicines, dyes, pesticides, oils, and rubber.
Plants create habitats for many organisms.
A single tree may provide food and shelter to many species of insects, worms, small mammals, birds, and reptiles We obviously can’t live without plants, but sometimes they cause us problems.
Many plants are weeds.
Weeds are plants that grow where people don’t want them, such as gardens and lawns.
They take up space and use resources, hindering the growth of more desirable plants.
People often introduce plants to new habitats where they lack natural predators and parasites. The introduced plants may spread rapidly and drive out native plants.
Many plants produce pollen, which can cause allergies.
<h5>Plants may also produce toxins that harm human healthWhy Study Plants?</h5>
Members of the plant kingdom play many crucial and sometimes surprising roles in the drama of life on Earth. You are probably familiar with some reasons plants are important.
<h6><sub>Why should you understand</sub> how plants live?</h6>
Because plants play many roles, including but certainly not limited to:
Supplying Food and Energy
Maintaining Earth’s Atmosphere
Cycling Water and Nurturing Soils
Contributing to Nitrogen and Other Biogeochemical Cycles
Interdependence with Animals
Interdependence with Fungi
Interdependence Among Plants
Resources for Humans
Aesthetics for Humans
Scientific Use by Humans
Causing Problems
More than 100,000 natural compounds come from plants, and most of these have yet to be explored. Some of the most powerful and useful compounds come from plants. Who knew they could help us unlock some of the biology's mysteries - all using an approach of mapping biological pathways.
